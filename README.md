# Bike-gimbal-01
This project is intended for the creation of a gimbal that can be used on the handlebars of a bike and eliminates the vibration caused by going down trails on a mountain bike.
# Initial steps
For the creation of this project first research needed to be done into the way that gimbals work and the way that they would need to be controlled.
